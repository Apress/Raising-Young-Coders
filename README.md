# Raising Young Coders: A Parent's Guide to Teaching Programming at Home
This is the Github repo for the book, [Raising Young Coders: A Parent's Guide to Teaching Programming at Home](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/979-8-8688-1393-1). This repository has resources which are designed to accompany the projects in the book. It is recommended that you [purchase the book](https://www.amazon.com/Raising-Young-Coders-Teaching-Programming/dp/B0DVBQZ483) so that you can learn how to inspire your own young coder!

## Chapter 1

This chapter talks about how to inspire your child to love technology. Since there are no projects in this chapter there is no corresponding folder in this repo.

## Chapter 2

This chapter introduces squishy ciruits to build your own pokeball and slime friend with play dough and to light it up with LEDs. The second project is a paper circuits project where you create arts and crafts circuits.

You can find the template for the paper circuits project in the [Chapter 2](./Chapter%202/) folder.

## Chapter 3

This chapter is focused on block coding and introduces the Makerzoid which is a build and code lego-like activity. The second project is the mBot line follower which is also programmable via block coding. Block coding is drag-and-drop style so there are no code files for this chapter.

## Chapter 4

This chapter is the most advanced and is for beginning Python coders. The micro:bit is a project where you program a small embedded board with built in sensors. The last project, the Raspberry Pi, is about wiring LED lights to a bread board and programming their blink patterns with a button press.

You can find the finished code for the micro:bit project in the [Chapter 4, Microbit](./Chapter%204/Microbit/) folder.

The three code examples for the Raspberry Pi can be found in the [Chapter 4, Raspberry Pi](./Chapter%204/Raspberry%20Pi/) folder.
## Chapter 5

This is a concluding chapter which explains about the importance of relatable role models and explores inspirational stories from five successful female technologists. There are no projects in this chapter, so there is no corresponding project folder.
